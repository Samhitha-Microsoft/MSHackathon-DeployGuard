#DeployGuard: Ensuring Seamless, Secure, and Time-Locked Cloud Deployments

DeployGuard is an innovative solution designed to streamline and secure cloud deployments by preventing simultaneous deployments in the same cloud region. This project aims to enhance the efficiency and reliability of deployment processes, reducing errors and saving valuable time for development teams.

With DeployGuard, a time-based locking mechanism is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that only one deployment can occur in a specific cloud region at any given time, while also allowing developers to lock a region for a specified duration. This feature provides a dedicated time window for testing and debugging, preventing conflicts and ensuring smooth workflows.

Once a region is locked for a specified time, other deployments are blocked until the lock expires, allowing developers to fully focus on testing their code. After the specified lock duration ends, the region is automatically unlocked, ready for the next deployment. This approach guarantees a seamless and uninterrupted testing experience.
